    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You must try this delicious recipe, a creamy pasta with pink sauce based on the classic penne alla vodka pasta. The secret to the incredibly tasty cream sauce is that it uses gin instead of vodka, along with tomato puree and fresh rosemary. This dish is a quick, plush-tasting pasta dinner you’ll crave again and again.</p>

        <li>2 ounces (350 g) dried penne, ziti or other tubular shaped pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45 g) butter
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45 g) butter
        </li>
        <li> ½ cup finely chopped onion or shallot
        </li>
        <li>½ cup (125 ml) gin or plain vodka
        </li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (300 g) tomato passata or puree
        </li>
        <li>1 cup (250 ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>½-1 teaspoon crushed red chili pepper, to your taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup (25 g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese , plus more for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Cooking the Pasta</li></h3>
        <p>Bring 5-6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot along with 3 tablespoons salt. Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <h3><li>Making the Sauce</li></h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, melt the butter over medium-high heat in a wide pan large enough to hold the pasta. Add the onion and cook 1 minute, or until softened.  Pour in the gin and lower the heat to medium-low. Gently simmer for 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add the tomatoes, cream, red pepper, rosemary and ½ teaspoon salt. Simmer for 10 minutes to thicken the sauce.
        </p>
        <h3><li>Putting it all Together</h3></li>
        <p>When the pasta is done, drain it and add to the pan. Reduce heat to low, add the cheese and stir until pasta is coated with the sauce. Serve with additional cheese and rosemary on top.
