    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients for the italian Party!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb dried lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3 cups Bolognese sauce
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan
        </li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups whole milk
        </li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Making the Ragu</li></h3>
        <p>As I mentioned above, a classic Italian ragu takes a couple of hours to simmer and develop its flavors. For me, this part of the lasagna is great to do ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>If you do not mind starting the sauce early in the day and then making the lasagna later on for dinner then you can make the ragu and lasagna all in the same day.
        </p>
        <p>For the ragu recipe, our favorite recipe and the one we use for this classic lasagna is this authentic bolognese from our sister site. If you would rather make a quicker meat sauce, our Italian American meat sauce is a great alternative to the ragu.
        </p>
        <h3><li>Making the Besciamella(White sauce!)</li></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter</li>
            <li>Add flour</li>
            <li>Cook flour and butter for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Add milk</li>
            <li>Add Parmesan, nutmeg and seasoning</li>
            <li>Place plastic wrap over sauce to prevent film while cooking pasta</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><li>Cooking the Lasagna Noodles</h3></li>
        <p>When cooking the lasagna noodles, you want to make sure that you cook them for only Â¾ of the time that the box says to cook them. You want the lasagna noodles to be a little flexible but not too much since they will continue cooking in the oven.</p>
        <p>Another tip is when the noodles are done cooking, lay them out on kitchen towels side by side so they do not stick to one another. The noodles will be very hot so kitchen tongs work well for grabbing them.
        </p>
        <h3><li>How to Assemble Lasagna Al Forno</li></h3>
        <p>First you want to butter a large baking dish. I like using a 9x8 pan because it is a little smaller than a 9x11 pan which gives me a taller lasagna. It also fits my lasagna noodles perfectly so there is less cutting them to fit.</p>
        <p>The next thing you want to do is add a little sauce to the bottom of your baking dish. I like to add 1 cup of reserved pasta water to the ragu sauce since ragu is very thick and you want the sauce to cook the pasta a little while it is in the oven.</p>
        <p>Next you add your first layer of lasagna noodles followed by a thin layer of the besciamella sauce then a little more ragu. You always want to add the besciamella sauce first then the ragu because it is easier to smooth the white sauce on its own.</p>
        <p>You will keep repeating these steps to assemble the lasagna until you get to the last lasagna layer. Once you lay down the last lasagna noodles, you are going to add the ragu on top of the lasagna noodles then top the whole thing off with the final bit of besciamella.</p>
        <p>The besciamella layer that is on the top along with a little Parmesan sprinkled over the top will brown and get nice and thick. That is why the besciamella needs to be the last layer before baking.</p>
